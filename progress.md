# EBANX PTP Testing Tool - Progress Tracking

## Project Overview
Python-based GUI application for testing payment methods across multiple Payment Type Profiles (PTPs) using the EBANX API. This is an internal testing tool for corporate use behind firewall with daily-changing API keys.

## MVP Implementation (Today)

### **✅ COMPLETED - Foundation & Core Structure**

- Data loading progress (test cards, PTP list)
- GUI widget creation and user interaction events
- API configuration and connection testing
- Complete API call logging (requests, responses, timing)
- Error handling and exception tracking with full tracebacks
- Payment analysis and response interpretation
- Console and file output for real-time and historical debugging

### **✅ COMPLETED - MVP Polish & Bug Fixes**
- [x] Fixed GUI layout issues and broken widget display
- [x] Simplified and improved UI structure
- [x] Add basic error handling and validation
- [x] Test with actual API calls
- [x] Add comprehensive logging system for debugging
- [x] Handle different response scenarios (success/error/3DS)

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies (requirements.txt)
```
PySide6>=6.7.0
typer>=0.9.0
rich>=13.7.0
requests>=2.31.0
json5>=0.9.0
```

### Current Project Structure
```
ebanx-ptp-tester/
├── data/
│   ├── ptp-list.txt ✅
│   ├── postman.json ✅
│   └── test_cards.json ✅ (gitignored)
├── run.py ✅ (Primary GUI using Qt)
├── test_data_only.py ✅ (headless logic test)
├── requirements.txt ✅
├── progress.md ✅
└── .gitignore ✅
```

### Test Data File
- **test_cards.json** - Contains all test data organized by country (gitignored for security)

This file contains sensitive test data and is excluded from version control. The structure includes:
- Customer data (name, email, phone, currency) per country
- Test cards organized by country (NG, KE, ZA, EG) and card type
- Mobile money test data (MPESA for Kenya)

## API Endpoints Supported
- `ws/direct` - Direct payment processing
- `ws/capture` - Payment capture
- `ws/query` - Payment status query
- `ws/refund` - Payment refund
- `ws/verifycard` - Card verification

## PTP Categories Identified
From ptp-list.txt analysis:
- **Payment Types**: banktransfer, debitcard
- **Acquirers**: flutterwave, paystack, cellulant, peach, payu
- **Countries**: ng (Nigeria), ke (Kenya), za (South Africa), eg (Egypt)
- **Features**: 3ds, otp, cof, hosted-url, recurrent, sandbox

## Current Status - MVP Complete
The application now has a fully functional Qt-based GUI (`run.py`). The previous Tkinter implementation has been removed, resolving macOS display issues.

## Recent Updates
- **✅ Added ZA Test Card**: South Africa Mastercard (5274600000493614) added to test_cards.json with proper ZAR currency and customer data
- **✅ Data Validation**: Confirmed JSON syntax is valid and test data loads correctly (5 total cards across 4 countries)
- **🔄 Unified State Management**: Card form fields and JSON payload are now bi-directionally synced. Editing card details updates the payload automatically, and modifying the payload JSON updates the card form in real-time.
- **🔍 PTP Filter Added**: Introduced a filter textbox above the PTP dropdown to quickly narrow down profiles.
- **❌ Removed Test Connection**: Test Connection button and its underlying network check were removed to streamline the UI.
- **👁️ Improved Observability (2024-07-27)**: The GUI now displays the full cURL command while the request is in flight, replacing it with the final API response once complete. Added `_build_curl_command` helper and updated `run_test` flow.
- **⚙️ Non-blocking API Calls (2024-07-27)**: `Run Test` now executes the API request in a background `QThread`, disabling the button (greyed out) until the call finishes, so the UI stays responsive.

## MVP Completion Status
1. ✅ Add API configuration UI (base URL, integration key)
2. ✅ Implement actual API calls to EBANX ws/direct endpoint
3. ✅ Handle API responses and display results
4. ✅ Comprehensive logging and debugging
5. ✅ **MVP FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** - GUI display issue on macOS
6. ✅ Implement card management (save, add, delete) features in Qt GUI
7. ✅ Editable payload with per-card saved custom payload support

## Known Issues
- Users could not previously manage test cards from the UI. ✅ **Fixed** – buttons to save existing cards, add new cards, reload from disk, and delete cards are now part of the Qt interface.
- Payload preview was read-only. ✅ **Fixed** – payload is now editable and can be saved into the selected card profile.

## Diagnostic / Helper Tools
`test_data_only.py` remains for quick logic verification without hitting the network or launching a GUI.

### Core Application Status
- **✅ Fully Functional**: All business logic, API calls, data loading
- **⚠️ Display Issue**: tkinter GUI hangs on macOS (common issue)
- **✅ Production Ready**: API integration works perfectly
- **✅ Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Immediate Use:
1. **Run Qt GUI**: `python3 run.py`
2. **Quick data verification**: `python3 test_data_only.py`

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Web interface (Flask/FastAPI) for remote usage
- [ ] Enhanced reporting and export options
- [ ] Import / export test card datasets (CSV / JSON)

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and usability for internal testing
- No need for fancy UI - functional and fast is priority
- API key changes daily - ensure easy configuration
- Corporate firewall considerations for network requests
- PTP list and postman.json moved to data/ directory for better organization
- **MVP is functionally complete** - Qt GUI resolved previous display issues
